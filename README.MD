## EMAT HACK
<h4>A small hack made for Emat</h4>

#
<h3>The story:</h3>
This "hack" for Emat was made cause i was bored in class one day, and suddenly i had the urge to make some code to make all my math homework for me

#
<h3>How to use:</h3>
Simply paste the file `EmatDystThingy.js` file into the web console. And then it ask for how fast you want to go. I have found the sweetspot to be at 615ms
