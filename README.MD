<h3>The story:</h3>
These scripts for Emat was made cause i was bored in class one day, and suddenly i had the urge to make some code to make all my math homework for me. Happens sometimes, i know.

<h3>How to use:</h3>
Simply paste the content of the files into the web console. And then it ask for how fast you want to go. I have found the sweetspot to be at 615ms
